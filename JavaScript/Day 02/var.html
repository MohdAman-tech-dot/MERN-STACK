        //There are 3 types of variables in JavaScript:
        //1. var - function scoped, can be redeclared and updated
        var x = 10;
        //2. let - block scoped, can be updated but not redeclared
        let y = 20;
        //3. const - block scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared
        const z = 30;

        //Example of var
        var a = 5;
        var b = 10;
        var sum = a + b; // sum is 15
        console.log("Sum using var:", sum);

        //Example of let
        let c = 15;
        let d = 25;
        let product = c * d; // product is 375
        console.log("Product using let:", product);

        //Example of const
        const e = 50;
        // const f = 60; // This would throw an error if uncommented, as const cannot be redeclared
        const difference = e - 20; // difference is 30
        console.log("Difference using const:", difference);
